# Excel-Bank-Management-Java
This is a Java program with the Apache Poi dependency. The program is just a demonstration of a Fake Bank Management system where data is input into excel and excel calculates
balances.


The program just demonstrates a few applications of the Apache POI but there are quite a few more implementations that can be done to improve this app.
List of things that need to done to improve app:

:Change int to double to enter value with cents.

:Using java create a method to calcuate the new bank account total of the bank account chosen. This was done using excel but there are many limitations to using excel that to make
a way and program it using java.

:Implement method to pull latest bank statements. For example a method to get last 10 Checking transactions. This could be done for all 3 methods seperatly and for all 3 bank
accounts latesst transaction.

:On all excel sheets there are a New Total column. What I had in mind was something similar to what my bank account does and show what my current total was at that time. Doing this
as a calculation on excel is a possiblility but I think that I would be better done using a function. I would prefer to tackle this problems soly through Java with no Excel 
functions.
