# Excel-Bank-Management-Java
This is a Java program with the Apache Poi dependency. The program demonstras is a fake bank account management system that is controlled through java and manipulates an excel file. The excel file is the bank accounts. There are 3 bank accounts which can be picked from and either read their data directly from the comand line or add new charges throught the comand line. 
This was programed using object oriented programing and a git team methodology. 

There are other implementations that can quickly be done if wished such as adding a method to add to your total. I did not do this I was more worried about a functional application. I had no use to creating that method but it can easily be done.

Final push has been made to this project. I have shown general understandning of apache poi, git commands, and java programming. Thank you for your time.
